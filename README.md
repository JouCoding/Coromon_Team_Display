Project explained by AI (cause I was too lazy):
# ⚡ Coromon Team Display - OBS (Browser) Tool

An easy-to-use team tracker for Coromon streamers. Customize your team, pick your layouts, and display them live on your stream in seconds.

## ✨ Features
- **Official Sprites:** Supports all Coromon species with Standard, Potent, and Perfect variations. (edit: I tried to get all Coromon skins but because the wiki hasn't been fully updated, some of the newer skins will just pngs instead of gifs)
- **Pixel Aesthetic:** Uses the classic pixel font for nicknames to match the in-game feel.
- **Dynamic Layouts:** Choose between Rows, Vertical Stacks, or Grids (2x3 or 3x2).
- **Pro Profiles:** Save different teams for your Nuzlockes, Speedruns, or Casual playthroughs.
- **Live Sync:** Changes update automatically in OBS without you having to refresh anything. (edit: if that doesn't work use the "static" links to update team (although you have to insert new link every time a change to the team is made))

## 🚀 Quick Start (How to use)

1. **Set your Name:** In the top right, enter a unique "Trainer Name". This is your private channel ID.
2. **Build your Team:** Select your Coromon, their skin, and give them a nickname.
3. **Customize:** Use the sidebar sliders to adjust spacing, glow intensity, and whether names appear above or below the sprites.
4. **Add to OBS:**
   - Find the **Overlay Links** section in the sidebar.
   - Click the **Live** button next to your preferred layout (e.g., "Row"). (edit: or **Static** if Live is stuck in loading)
   - In OBS, create a new **Browser Source**.
   - Paste the link and set the Width/Height (usually 1920x1080 for full control).

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Profiles:** Use the "Profiles" section to switch between different teams or run types instantly.
- **Static Links:** If you have unstable internet, use the **Static** link button. Note: You will need to copy-paste a new link every time you change your team if you use Static.
- **The Glow:** Use the "Coromon Glow" slider to make your sprites pop against dark backgrounds.

## 🛠️ Need Help?
If your team isn't updating in OBS,  click the **"Apply Changes Manually"** button at the top of the sidebar. This forces a sync to the cloud. (edit: not fully sure if it works but is there as an option)
